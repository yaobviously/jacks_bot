# Jack's Bot

This is a simple chatbot app that uses the OpenAI API and a custom prompt to provide my son with a ChatGPT experience that's both personalized and tailored to his level of understanding. 

Importantly, the app maintains the history of the conversation by storing 'user' and 'assistant' text histories and prepending them to prompts. This allows the conversation to evolve naturally, much as the chat.openai.com app does. 

I included the running cost of using the app because my son likes numbers. It seemed like something worth figuring out how to get and then I left it in for him.

In future I'd like to add text streaming as well as 'suggested' quesetions or question-stems for my son to use, e.g., "How does _____ work?" "Why does X happen?" I'll put these Jack-prompts alongside the main chat to give him some ideas for how to continue the conversation.

This app was to give my son a fun and engaging way to learn how interact with the latest technology. So far, he seems to really enjoy it.
